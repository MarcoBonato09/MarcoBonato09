# Hey, I'm Marco.
I'm (at the time of making this) a 16-year old teenager. I love mathematics and I enjoy computer programming. While I am currently focusing on my studies, I am pursuing learning data engineering. I hope to become a data engineer and eventually work my way up the data science hierarchy of needs (see bottom) as I gain experience.
